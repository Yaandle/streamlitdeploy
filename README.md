This app was made to help test different YOLOv8 models.
It includes:
- MFIT, to run detection and segmentation tasks on single, multi-image and video sources.
- ODIS, to sort images based on class name. 


To find the models and datasets we use, visit: https://streamlitultralytics-6mwxw6m26q-as.a.run.app/Technology

Multi-Feature Inference Testing:
Select a model or upload your own, select a task then either upload an image, multiply images or a video.
